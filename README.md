# schafkopf-base-engine

The goal of this project is to provide an engine for playing Schafkopf. The main purpose of this engine is to build a basis for experiments by providing a TCP interface. This interface can be used by components implementing a player participating in the game, e.g. an interactive UI or some instance of artificial intelligence.
